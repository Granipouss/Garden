# Garden

> Inspired by [SimulatedGREG's electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue)

## Overview

The aim of this project is to remove the need of manually setting up electron apps using vue. electron-vue takes advantage of `vue-cli` for scaffolding, `webpack` with `vue-loader`, `electron-packager` or `electron-builder`, and some of the most used plugins like `vue-router`, `vuex`, `bulma`, and so much more.

#### Check out the detailed documentation [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).

Things you'll find in this boilerplate...

* Basic project structure with a **single** `package.json` setup
* Detailed [documentation](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/)
* Project scaffolding using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
* Ready to use Vue plugins \([axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios), [vue-electron](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/vue-electron), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router), [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)\)\*
* Installed [vue-devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) and [devtron](https://github.com/electron/devtron) tools for development
* Ability to easily package your electron app using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) or [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)\*
* `appveyor.yml` and `.travis.yml` configurations for automated deployments with [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)\*
* Ability to produce web output for browsers
* Handy [NPM scripts](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/en/npm_scripts.html)

* ESLint \(with support for [`standard`](https://github.com/feross/standard) and [`airbnb-base`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)\)\*
* Unit Testing \(with Karma + Mocha\)\*
* End-to-end Testing \(with Spectron + Mocha\)\*

\*Customizable during vue-cli scaffolding

### Getting Started

This boilerplate was built as a template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and includes options to customize your final scaffolded app. The use of `node@^7` or higher required. electron-vue also officially recommends the [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.org) package manager as it handles dependencies much better and can help reduce final build size with `yarn clean`.

```bash
# Install vue-cli and scaffold boilerplate
npm install -g vue-cli
vue init Granipouss/Garden my-project

# Install dependencies and run your app
cd my-project
yarn # or npm install
yarn run dev # or npm run dev
```
